# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in the RECON community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, actual or perceived sexual identity and orientation, gender identity and expression, or sex characteristics. 
We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include (but are not limited to):

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
  advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email
  address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all RECON community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing RECON. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event (such as RECON training activities) or when on deployments as a RECON member.

## Reporting Guidelines
Instances of behaviour that is abusive, harassing or otherwise unacceptable may be reported to the RECON Code of Conduct Committee. This includes ____ (_____), ____ (_____) and _____ (_____). If you experience or witness unacceptable behaviour or have any other concerns, please submit a report to the Committee as soon as possible using this form: https://forms.gle/jbfjVz3EHn4hydW9A - the information in this form will go to all three Committee members. Alternatively, you may email <repidemicsconsortium.complaints@gmail.com> or make a report directly to one member of the Committee by contacting them directly â€“ either via email or the RECON Slack Channel. If any member of the Committee has a conflict of interest with a report, they will be recused and will not have access to the content or process of the report follow-up. 

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly - the Code of Conduct Committee will investigate and decide an appropriate response to reports with the aim of making a decision as soon as is reasonably possible. This decision will then be communicated to RECON's Executive Board as a recommendation for action. The RECON Executive Board will then vote on accepting the recommendation. If passed, the Executive Board will be responsible for enforcing the recommendation for action as stipulated by the Code of Conduct Committee. Any Board members involved in the complaint will be recused and will be unable to cast a vote or attend the meeting where the matter is voted on. Throughout the process, members of the Code of Conduct Committee and the RECON Executive Board are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident. The Code of Conduct Committee will not communicate the identity of the reporter to the Board unless given express permission to do so by the complainant.
